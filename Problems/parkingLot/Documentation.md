*Imagine you’re arriving at a busy parking lot, eager to park your car. At the entrance, you’re issued a ticket. You then drive in, find a spot suited to your vehicle’s size, and park.

Behind the scenes, the parking lot is assigning spots based on vehicle size, recording entry and exit times, and updating availability for new arrivals. Now, let’s design a parking lot system that handles all this.*
